# DASHBOARD DEPLOYMENT
For deploying the dashboard, you have to edit the files `dash_and_mongo_pvc_and_vols-template.yaml` and `eucaim-ingress-template.yaml` and add the IP address of your NFS server. And you may also add or uncomment the lines for requesting resources at `dashb-mongo.yaml` and `eucaim-dashboard-template.yaml`
