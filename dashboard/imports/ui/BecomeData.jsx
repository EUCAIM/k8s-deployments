            <p>EUCAIM welcomes a diverse range of Data Providers, each with unique capabilities and contributions in both research and clinical environments:</p>

            <h5>Research Environment:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><p><b>Central Repository Providers:</b> If you've completed research projects and aim to maintain your datasets for long-term research availability but need support, EUCAIM offers a solution. By becoming a Central Repository Provider, you will directly transfer your data to our Central Storage, ensuring it remains accessible to other researchers. The process involves signing a Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) and sharing information about your project, metadata catalogue, and software. We will guide you through data de-identification, making your contribution hassle-free.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Federated Providers:</b> If you manage active repositories and want to maintain your datasets within a federated node, EUCAIM provides the platform. As a Federated Provider, you'll collaborate with us through a Data Sharing Agreement (DSA). Share details about your research project, metadata catalogue, and software, along with information about your local computational and storage capabilities. Once your project concludes, we anticipate transitioning it to our Central Storage, ensuring its lasting impact.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Research Communities:</b> For finalized projects that wish to keep their datasets accessible for research while nurturing the community of researchers behind them, EUCAIM offers a unique opportunity. Data from Research Communities is transferred to our Central Storage, allowing you to continue collaborating and working with your data and tools. To get started, sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) while providing insights into your research project, partners, metadata catalogue, and software.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Clinical Environment:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Hospital Providers:</b> In the clinical realm, hospitals with their Real-World Data scenarios, sourced from Electronic Health Records (EHR), become crucial Data Providers. Hospitals prepare specific datasets for agreed-upon projects. They decide whether to transfer these datasets to our Central Repository or keep them within a federated node. Agreements such as DSA/DTA per project and Collaborative Agreement (CA) per project ensure a structured and secure collaboration. Share your metadata catalogue and details about your hospital's data warehouse structure to embark on this impactful journey.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Regardless of your role, EUCAIM offers a platform for your unique contributions. We are committed to empowering your participation and ensuring your journey as a Data Provider is straightforward and impactful.</p>

        </div>

        <div className="container">
          <div className="row pt-5">

            <p>At EUCAIM, we recognize the significance of large datasets in advancing cancer research and generating meaningful insights that drive innovation. Your contribution is pivotal in achieving this objective.</p>

            <p><b>Smooth Onboarding Process</b></p>
            <p>To facilitate your participation as a Data Provider, we have devised a smooth onboarding process. We firmly believe that the minimum requirement for joining EUCAIM is the provision of your project-specific datasets. Alongside your data, we require compliance with all legal obligations, including the necessary agreements with EUCAIM. In addition, some project metadata and documentation will be necessary to facilitate the understanding of the origin and structure of the provided data, in order to work with it.</p>
            <p><b>Flexibility in Data Compliance</b></p>
            <p>We understand that adapting your data to our hyper-ontology and our common data model may pose challenges. Therefore, non-compliance with the Data Federation Framework (DFF) defined by EUCAIM will not impede your participation. Instead, we will incentivize data curation and facilitate data transformation, if necessary, to align with our DFF.</p>
            <p><b>Three Tiers of Data Compliance</b></p>
            <p>To accommodate different levels of data compliance, we have established three technical tiers. These tiers are scalable, allowing you to upgrade as your datasets are used in new research projects. Each tier offers increased visibility and usability of your data within the EUCAIM community.</p>
            <p>
              <div>Tier 1: Acceptance of data with no DFF compliance, suitable for entry-level participation.</div>
              <div>Tier 2: Medium compliance with the DFF, enabling federated search functionality.</div>
              <div>Tier 3: Full compliance with the DFF, allowing distributed processing, including machine learning model training.</div>
            </p>
            <p><b>Our Commitment to Your Success</b></p>
            <p>EUCAIM is committed to facilitating your journey towards higher data compliance levels. We provide support, adaptation plans, and even seek project fundings to assist you in achieving Tier 2 and Tier 3 compliance.</p>
            <p><b>Infrastructure Requirements: Central Repository or Federated Node</b></p>
            <p>In EUCAIM, we provide you with the flexibility to choose between two primary approaches for contributing your data, accommodating your specific needs and preferences. You can opt to transfer your data to the Central Repository managed by the EUCAIM federation, or alternatively, maintain your data and share it as a Federated Node. Both options are equally valid and enable you to contribute to cancer research in EUCAIM in accordance with your preferences and requirements. If you decide to use the Central Repository, your onboarding process will be more straightforward, allowing you to contribute your data directly, following established legal and ethical processes. On the other hand, if you prefer to retain control over your data and share it under project-specific approvals, the option to be a Federated Node is ideal. This allows you to maintain autonomy and oversight of your data. In this case, it's important to note that resources for storage and computation will be necessary to support your role as a Federated Node.</p>
            <p><b>Legal Compliance: Your Data, Our Responsibility</b></p>
            <p>As a Data Provider, your data is essential to EUCAIM. As such, you need to ensure GDPR and national law compliance, provide proof of data origin and a valid legal basis for processing, and demonstrate your commitment to data protection through GDPR compliance and reports from Data Protection Officers confirming adherence to EUCAIM's standards.</p>
            <p><b>Ethical Standards: Your Commitment to Integrity</b></p>
            <p>Ethics are at the core of our mission. Embrace ethical data practices, support treatments approved by the Data Access Committee, and collaborate in ethical verification activities to ensure responsible data sharing. Your dedication to legal compliance and ethical standards is vital to EUCAIM's success in advancing cancer research and innovation.</p>
            <p><b>Join EUCAIM Today</b></p>
            <p>In summary, EUCAIM aims to create an environment that streamlines the integration of new Data Providers while maintaining high data quality standards. We invite you to join EUCAIM, contribute your valuable data, and be part of our mission to advance cancer research and innovation.</p>
